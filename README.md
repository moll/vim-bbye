Bbye (Buffer Bye) for Vim
==========================
Bbye allows you to do delete buffers (close files) without closing your windows or messing up your layout.

Vim by default closes all windows that have the buffer (file) open when you do `:bdelete`.  If you've just got your splits and columns perfectly tuned, having them messed up equals a punch in the face and that's no way to tango.

Bbye gives you a `:Bdelete` command that behaves like a well designed citizen:

- Closes and removes the buffer.
- Shows another file in that window.
- Shows an empty file if you've got no other files open.
- Does not leave useless `[no file]` buffers if you decide to edit another file in that window.
- Works even if a file's open in multiple windows.
- Works a-okay with various buffer explorers and tabbars.

Regain your throne as king of buffers!


Installing
----------
The easiest and most modular way is to download Bbye to `~/.vim/bundle`:
```
mkdir -p ~/.vim/bundle/bbye
```

Using Git:
```
git clone https://github.com/moll/vim-bbye.git ~/.vim/bundle/bbye
```

Using Wget:
```
wget https://github.com/moll/vim-bbye/archive/master.tar.gz -O- | tar -xf- --strip-components 1 -C ~/.vim/bundle/bbye
```

Then prepend that directory to Vim's `&runtimepath` (or use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen)):
```
set runtimepath^=~/.vim/bundle/bbye
```


Using
-----
Instead of using `:bdelete`, use `:Bdelete`.
Fortunately autocomplete helps by sorting `:Bdelete` before its lowercase brother.

As it's likely you'll be using `:Bdelete` often, make a shortcut to `\q`, for example, to save time. Throw this to your `vimrc`:
```
:nnoremap <Leader>q :Bdelete<CR>
```

### Closing all open buffers and files

Occasionally you'll want to close all open buffers and files while leaving your pristine window setup as is. That's easy. Just do:
```
:bufdo :Bdelete
```

### Aliasing to :Bclose

If you've used any `Bclose.vim` scripts before and for some reason need the `:Bclose` command to exist, you may make an alias:
```
command! -bang -complete=buffer -nargs=? Bclose Bdelete<bang> <args>
```

### Integration with buffer list plugins

There are plugins that make buffers tab-local (such as [vim-drawer], [vim-ctrlspace] or [betterTabs]) or otherwise limit buffer switching.

If you use one of these, `:Bdelete` may switch to an unwanted buffer.
To avoid this problem, tell bbye to use the plugin's "previous buffer" command, e.g.:
```
let g:bbye_previous_command = 'VimDrawerPreviousBuffer'
```
